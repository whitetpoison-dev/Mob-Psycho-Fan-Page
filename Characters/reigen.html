    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
    Reigen is a tall man with dark brown eyes and short, reddish-blond hair with messy bangs. 
    He is also very vibrant with his facial expressions ranging anywhere from attractive to terrifying, 
    and he tends to sweat profusely.<br/>
    He is usually shown wearing a dark grey business suit with a pink or black tie, 
    though he has also worn such outfits as a sweatsuit, a tank top with shorts, and a complete 
    high school girls' uniform. Still, that revealed that he also has relatively hairy legs.
